## Setup:

1. `npm init -y` to create a new `package.json` file with default values for all fields. The `-y` flag stands for "yes" (automatically answer "yes" to all the prompts).
2. Custom script in the the `package.json` file:
   ```
   "scripts": {
    "server": "nodemon index"
   },
   ```
3. Start the server for the Node.js application: `npm run server`
